/*
  A common module that can be imported by all components/pages,
  without importing a bunch of classes (that end up being repeated 
  for each component). Think of this as a place to put your "utils"
  scss files.

  Avoid adding selectors that affect DOM nodes (i.e. ".foo" or "body")
  since those end up being repeated every time they are imported.
  (a bundler would solve this problem)
